# PROJECT NAME
Weekend-jquery-server-calculator

## Description

_Duration: ~ 8 hours_

This is a basic calculator project. This is meant to grab the inputs from the DOM of a webpage. It then takes the inputs and sends them to the server side to do all calculations. We then send back the answer to the math problem entered. Finally, we append the data entered as well as the answer to the dom.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. run 'npm install'. this should install all necessary files so long as you have node.js installed
2. to turn the server on, simply type 'npm start' into the console. you should be prompted with a 'listening on port 5000' if this worked
3. next go to the url 'http://localhost:5000/' in your browser of choice.
4. the calculator should now be visable to you on the webpage. 

## Usage

1. enter in a number into the first input field
2. enter in a number into the second input field
3. select an operator used to complete the math between the two inputs
4. press the '=' button
5. the most recent answer and the history of previous inputs into the calculator should appear below the inputs
6. if youd like to clear the history, answer or even the input fields, press the 'C' button
